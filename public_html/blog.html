      	      <p class="entry"> The first part of this assignment was not very challenging. I have some exposure to HTML so most of the "skeleton" was review for me. However, I was challenged with publishing the website and allowing permission for it to be viewed. For this, the most useful resource was the TA office hours. Another useful source I used was the Unix permission page that was posted with the assignment. Another aspect of this project that I struggled with was inserting an image. I tried a variety of ways to do this, but the most effective was dragging and dropping my image in the public_html and calling it image.jpg to refer to it in index.html. I used Piazza to figure this out.</p>

             <p class="entry">This assignment was challenging at first, specifically because I wasn't accessing elements correctly. However, when I visited a TA's office hours, he helped me understand class and ID selectors. He also showed how to use Chrome's developer tools, and that made the assignment much easier. Using the "Inspect" feature, I made small adjustments to see what looked good and added those attributes in my code. I learned of new methods to apply CSS to a webpage. My favorite thing learned is psuedo classes and how to make elements special when they are being hovered over, clicked on etc. I used many resources to accomplish this project, including Piazza, TA office hours, CSS tutorial webpages, Stack Overflow, and more. I had to use google to learn about flex boxes and how to get the specific color of an element. </p>

         <h3 class="date">05/14/2018</h3>
            <p class="entry">When I first began this assignment, I was confused by the specific syntax that is used by JavaScript to access and manipulate HTML elements. However, once I started figuring things out and understanding the differences between methods (getting elemetns by id, class name, and tag name), I realized this assignment isn't too difficult. I was actually surprised at how quick I was able to complete it. One of the most useful tools was JSFiddle. I wrote and tested code in there and then transferred what worked to my assignment. I constantly pushed my work onto github so I could directly copy it from there to JSFiddle. I googled many things to read further documentation on how to manipulate the DOM. I read articles that explained how certain methods worked and I relied heavily on Eloquent JavaScript and W3Schools. Upon finishing this assignment, I feel more confident with my skills in JS and I am used to the quirks that is included in this language's methods.</p>

      <div id="assignment">
         <h2 class="title">Assignment 4 Entry</h2>
         <h3 class="date">05/21/2018</h3>
            <p class="entry">This project was the most difficult assignment in this course by far. I have worked previously with JS/HTML/CSS but this is my first time writing server-side javascript. I was challenged with this homework because I was confused on how the Oregon State ENGR server ran on my local laptop. I figured out that I needed to clone the assignment onto my local machine and start the server from the Node.js command prompt that lives locally on my computer. I spent a lot of time at the start just trying to print “Hello World” to the browser from my server.js. Once I figured this out, I was able to test my work. One thing that made my program crash was I was using readFile() instead of readFileSync to save the files in /public. I also did not set the content in my if statements and made some small mistakes in accessing from the correct directories. Once I made these changes, the rest of the assignment was pretty straight forward. I had to Google the list of built-in node modules and their associated functions. I also looked at Rob’s example code and his notes on the Node.js basics.</p>

      <div id="assignment">
	 <h2 class="title">Assignment 5 Entry</h2>
	 <h3 class="date">06/03/2018</h3>
	    <p>As always, I was challenged by this assignment in the beginning.  I ran into a problem when I was trying to run my code in the beginning (not going to lie I panicked a little bit). I couldn’t download the entire node_modules folder on my local machine, so I couldn’t access the npm dependencies I needed. However, the command prompt led me to manually install all the packages. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to get past this problem. Without fixing these errors, I couldn’t test my code so I was unable to write the templates without solving it.</p>
       	 <p>However, once I was able to get the server running again, the rest of the assignment took me about two hours. As I continued to work, I realized we just had to implement the same things that Professor Hess did in lecture. After I noticed that, I relied heavily on the example code published from class and the templeting notes from week 8 on his website. Once I templated all the pages and sorted all the handlebars files, I noticed most of them were short and no longer than 30 lines. This increased the efficiency of the website and got rid of the duplicated pieces of code. I understand a lot more about dynamically changing a website.</p>
